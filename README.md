# ntru-cryptosystem
NTRUis one ofthe few public key cryptosystems which is supposedly
quantum-computerresistant.Its securityisbasedonthepresumeddifficultyof
a lattice problem, namely,the shortest vector problem. This project describes
the NTRU cryptosystem and its cryptanalysis. The project describes how NTRU

encryption text. Finally, a comparison of the performance of the NTRU with
another public key cryptosystem RSA is presented which describes the fast
implementation of the NTRU algorithm as compared to various other
cryptosystems. The project consists of a full and deep research and analysis on
NTRU algorithm.
